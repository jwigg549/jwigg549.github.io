  <p style="font-size:160%;">Sophmore in Greenville, South Carolina.</p>
  <p style="font-family:courier;">I am a Sports Management Sophmore at <a href="http://www.bju.edu/?gclid=COXxh-bY6NECFY66wAodFiIGzQ">Bob Jones University</a> who lives in Hammonton, New Jersey.  I work for the <a href="http://www.bjubruins.com/index.aspx?path=mbball">BJU Men's Basketball Team</a> as Head of Statistics and Analytics. My life long goal is to become an NBA head coach. In order to get there, I am currently working as the head of statistics and analytics for the Bruins basketball team. I am also working on building a cliental of young basketball players to train and teach to be better overall Christian athletes. Using this platform of coaching I am seeking to make an impact on younger generations, and pave the way for future Christians in the sports industry.</p>
  <p style="font-family:courier;">I enjoy other things outside of coaching basketball. I enjoy wood carving and playing the trumpet. I also excel at building my social network in the sports community. I enjoy spending time with my family and close friends and building relationships with them that could not be broken. I also like to spend a lot of time reading sports and history books. Right now I am genuinely enjoying being an officer in my society and getting to know the guys better.</p>
